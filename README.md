## Paytr indexer

Indexer for the Paytr protocol created using Envio's contract import feature.  Took ~1 minute and 2 commands to create this indexer.

Note: HyperSync supports Polygon but not Mumbai so we're currently using a free Mumbai rpc in `config.yaml` to sync.  To take advantage of Envio's syncing speeds, switch to HyperSync when this contract is deployed on Polygon.

*Please refer to the [documentation website](https://docs.envio.dev) for a thorough guide on all Envio indexer features*
